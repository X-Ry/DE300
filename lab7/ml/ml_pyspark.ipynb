    "It seems like this increase in AUC ROC indicates a more robust and generalizable model. This is in part due to the squared features contributing to capturing non-linear relationships more effectively, and the change in number of trees and the subsequent reduction in tree depth may have helped in avoiding overfitting and better generalization. Overall these modifications that I made seem to help improve model accuracy in predictions!"
