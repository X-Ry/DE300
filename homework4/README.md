Task 3 - Two separate Feature Engineering Strategies (imputing smoke column)

Task 3.5 - Perform Web Scraping --> merge the feature engineering variables with the web scraped data for smoke

Task 4 - Train two sklearn models (log regression and svm respectively), two Spark models, and two more sklearn models for the merged data

Task 5 - Compare the acccuracy of each model and decide on a best one

Task 6 - run evaluation and metrics on the model, based on which type of model it is (if it's Spark or sklearn.)
